# Hangman
This is a Hangman game that takes the name of the user and then let the user guess the word
if the guess is correct then the letter is written in its place in the word if it s wrong 
then it tells the user that his/her guess is wrong and increment a counter that each time 
the user makes a wrong guess it increments this counter until it arrives at a certain number 
of  false answers and then it means the user has lost.
